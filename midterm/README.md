# Dog Park - Catching the Ball
### Description
- Attractor(): Human
- Mover(): Dog
- Ball(): Ball
- Every time the user clickes the mouse:
  - the ball will show up and go away from the human and stop by a certain distance
  - the dog will then be attracted to the ball instead of the human
  - after ball is brought back to the human, the ball will disappear 
  - right now, only one ball will display at a time
- Since it's an ecosystem, there will be multiple Human-Dog-Ball pairs. Each Human-Dog-Ball pair will have a unique color. 
- Involve keyboard intervention
- Other intervention simulating nature, e.g. sunlights, winds, dog-dog interaction

### Problems/Challenges
- Need to review the mouseClicked function and use a global boolean to control the (dis)appearance of the ball 
- Haven't designed the best way that ball should move

### Notes
- Border-check can be ignored or the ecosystem will not appear so natural
